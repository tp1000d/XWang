In this paper, a liquid neural network-based method is proposed for continuous-time beam tracking in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) scenarios. Unlike discrete-time methods, this framework allows for real-time updates of beam directions under fast-varying user mobility. The network dynamically adjusts its temporal memory and structure, enhancing resilience and tracking performance even in high-mobility environments. The experimental results show superior accuracy and latency over baseline models.
