This survey paper introduces Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) as a robust and interpretable AI framework for next-generation telecom systems. LNNs are designed to address challenges in dynamic environments, offering enhanced adaptability and transparency compared to traditional neural networks. The authors discuss the mechanisms of LNNs, their advantages over conventional models, and explore their potential applications in wireless networks. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the performance of LNNs in real-world scenarios. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
