This paper introduces a gradient-based manifold meta learning method (GMML) for robust beamforming in RIS-aided communications. By integrating meta learning and manifold learning, GMML enhances spectral efficiency and reduces high-dimensional signal processing overhead. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that directly use channel state information, GMML inputs gradients of the precoding and phase shifting matrices into neural networks. A differential regulator is designed to constrain the RIS phase shifting matrix. Numerical results demonstrate that GMML improves spectral efficiency by up to 7.31% and accelerates convergence by 23 times compared to traditional approaches.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
