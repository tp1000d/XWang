This paper proposes a robust gradient-based liquid neural network (GLNN) framework for beamforming in mmWave MIMO communications. GLNN utilizes ordinary differential equation-based liquid neurons and inputs gradients of the optimization objective to extract high-order channel features. Manifold learning techniques compress the search space, and residual connections mitigate training burdens. Simulations demonstrate that GLNN achieves 4.15% higher spectral efficiency and reduces time consumption to 1.61% compared to conventional methods.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
