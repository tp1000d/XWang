This paper introduces a gradient-based meta learning beamforming (GMLB) approach for RISs-aided communications. GMLB feeds the gradient of the sum rate into neural networks and employs a differential regulator for RIS phase shift optimization. Meta learning iteratively optimizes beamforming matrices at both BSs and RISs. The proposed method operates without energy-consuming pre-training and achieves higher sum rates with energy consumption reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional algorithms.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
