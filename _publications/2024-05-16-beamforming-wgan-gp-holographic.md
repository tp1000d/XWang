This paper presents a beamforming inference scheme using conditional WGAN-GP for holographic antenna arrays. The proposed method infers high-dimensional beamforming matrices from extremely low-dimensional channel information, leveraging the distribution extraction capabilities of WGAN-GP without complex neural network designs. The adversarial training between the generator and discriminator enables the generator to learn the exact distribution of target beamforming matrices. Simulation results show that this approach reduces overhead by over 50% compared to traditional methods.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
