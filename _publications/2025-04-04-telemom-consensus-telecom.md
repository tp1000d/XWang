This paper introduces TeleMoM, a consensus-driven ensemble framework that integrates multiple large language models (LLMs) to enhance decision-making in telecom applications. TeleMoM employs a two-stage process: proponent models generate justified responses, and an adjudicator finalizes decisions, supported by a quality-checking mechanism. This approach leverages the strengths of diverse models to improve accuracy, reduce biases, and handle domain-specific complexities effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that TeleMoM achieves a 9.7% increase in answer accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in telecom applications. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
